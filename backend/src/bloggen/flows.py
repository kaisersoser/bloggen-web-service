CrewAI Blog Generation Flow - Structured workflow with real-time status updates

This module implements a Flow-based approach to blog generation using CrewAI Flows.
Instead of relying on log interception, it provides explicit control points where
we can send meaningful, business-relevant status updates to the frontend.

The flow is structured into clear phases:
1. Research Phase - Gather information and insights on the topic
2. Content Generation - Create the initial blog draft with images
3. Fact Checking - Verify accuracy and add credibility
4. Finalization - Polish and format the final blog post

Each phase sends custom status updates via WebSocket to provide real-time feedback.
The content generation phase now includes automatic image integration via Unsplash API.
